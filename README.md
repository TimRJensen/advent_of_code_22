# Advent of code 2022
This event provides an opportunity to get familiar with a language that I always wanted to try: [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Rules of engagement
- Adheer to Go [coding standards and idioms](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/).
- Implementation should work for any input size and for malformed input.
- No magic numbers or strings, except for:
- - Char (rune) arithmetic.
  - Even/odd expressions.
  - For loop initializers, end conditions and steps.
  - Array, slice, map or struct initializers, including length and capacity arguments to make.
  - Path to input and commandline arguments.
- No external packages.
- KISS.
